Three primary simulation scripts, depending on how Tb is determined as a phenotype

*Tb_genetic_base_regulator.slim* - (Tb-genetic) - Tb is a genetically-coded trait

*Tb_emergent_base_regulator.slim* - (Tb-emergent) - Tb is the average of protein thermal optima

*Tb_emergent_base_ectotherm.slim* - (Tb-conform) - Tb is an externally-set value



Two additional simulation scripts:

*./additional_scripts/Tb_genetic_base_regulator_Gaussian.slim* - modified Tb-genetic script with Gaussian protein fitness functions instead of asymmetric thermal performance curves

*./additional_scripts/Tb_genetic_base_regulator_Var.slim* - modified Tb-genetic script to obtain genetic variances
